# tsuribura (ツリーでぶらさがった漫画をイッキに読むやつ)
## Overview

Tsuribura is web service and chrome extension supporting to read comics in twitter.

Web service part is written by Flask for my practice at about 2020/9 - 2021/2.

As such, it is very rudimentary and designed to run on inexpensive web servers (ex. さくらの Web サーバー).

## Sample

~~See https://peraimaru.site/~~

~~This link may suddenly become unavailable.~~

Service has been terminated due to the Twitter API becoming chargeable 😭.

## Design

Flask app is execed as cgi mode (see `index.cgi`).

To reduce server load, it uses as possible as static page.

For example, ranking page is generated by `./script/UpdateRanking.py` that is execed regularly by cron.

さくらの Web サーバー is inexpensive, allows cron execution and has attached MySQL server.
